/** @defgroup CLOCK_NSS clock: Clock driver
 * @ingroup DRV_NSS
 * The Clock driver provides the API to control functionalities related with the handling of clocks.
 * This functionality is part of the SYSCON HW block, however, for clarity it is exposed in an API separate from the
 * SYSCON driver.
 * @note All the registers that belong to the SYSCON HW block (including the ones related with handling of clocks) are
 *  defined in the SYSCON driver.
 *
 * The chip provides two internal clock sources:
 *  - System Oscillator (SFRO) which runs at 8MHz and is the clock source for the System Clock (AHB Clock), Peripheral
 *      Clocks and Watchdog Clock domains.
 *  - Timer Oscillator (TFRO) which runs at 32.768 kHz and is the clock source for the PMU and RTC.
 *  .
 * The Clock driver allows configuring the separate clocks that drive all the mentioned domains, namely regarding
 * division, gating and selection of the clock sources.
 *
 * @par Clock Division:
 *  The chip provides three separate clock dividers, all acting on the SFRO clock, that output three separate clocks:
 *      -# System Clock divider: Divides the SFRO into the clock that drives the System Clock (AHB Clock) and the
 *          Peripheral Clocks. This divider is configured to 16 by default (500 kHz) and can be configured using the
 *          #Chip_Clock_System_SetClockFreq function.
 *      -# SPI Clock divider: Divides the SFRO into the clock that drives the SPI HW block. This divider is configured
 *          to 0 by default (disabled) and can be configured using the #Chip_Clock_SPI0_SetClockFreq function.
 *      -# Watchdog Clock divider: Divides the selected Watchdog clock source (SFRO by default) into the clock that
 *          drives the Watchdog timer. This divider is configured to 0 by default (disabled) and can be configured using
 *          the #Chip_Clock_Watchdog_SetClockFreq function.
 *      .
 *
 * @par Clock Gating:
 *  The clocks to peripheral HW blocks can be enabled and disabled using, respectively, the #Chip_Clock_Peripheral_EnableClock
 *  and #Chip_Clock_Peripheral_DisableClock functions. The HW blocks whose clock can be disabled/enabled are defined in
 *  #CLOCK_PERIPHERAL_T enum. All peripheral clocks are disabled by default except for the RAM memory, Flash controller,
 *  Flash memory, IOCON block, EEPROM controller and EEPROM memory.
 *
 * @par Clock Selection:
 *  The chip allows selecting the clock source for two separate clocks:
 *      - Watchdog Timer: The clock source for the Watchdog timer is configured to the SFRO (#CLOCK_WATCHDOGSOURCE_SFRO)
 *          by default and can be configured using the #Chip_Clock_Watchdog_SetClockSource function.
 *      - Clock Output pin: The clock source for CLKOUT pin is disabled by default (#CLOCK_CLKOUTSOURCE_DISABLED), however
 *          it can be configured using the #Chip_Clock_Clkout_SetClockSource function. Note that the pin must be properly
 *          configured so that it can output the required clock. Please refer to @ref IOCON_NSS "IOCON driver" for pin
 *          configuration.
 *      .
 *  Note that the TFRO is part of the Power Management Unit (PMU) HW block, which is an always-on power domain. The
 *  handling of this clock source is, thus, covered in the @ref PMU_NSS "PMU driver".
