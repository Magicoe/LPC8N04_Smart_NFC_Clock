/** @defgroup TSEN_NSS tsen: Temperature Sensor driver
 * @ingroup DRV_NSS
 * The Temperature Sensor driver (TSen) provides the API to control all the functionalities of the Temperature Sensor HW block.
 * This block reads the temperature, in Kelvin, using a configured resolution. The block does feature interrupt when
 * measurement complete, but it does not feature continuous mode.
 *
 * @par Sensor State Description:
 *  -# The Temperature Sensor follows a simple 2 state (Idle <-> In Operation) approach.
 *      After the driver is initialized (#Chip_TSen_Init) it is ensured to be in the "Idle" state. The
 *      shall be set in this state (#Chip_TSen_SetResolution). The status information for the Temperature Sensor can be
 *      required resolution read at any time with the #Chip_TSen_ReadStatus function.
 *  -# The transition to the "In Operation" state is triggered with the #Chip_TSen_Start function. During this transition,
 *      the settings loaded during the "Idle" state will be used and the measurement will start.
 *      Calling the #Chip_TSen_Start function in the "In Operation" state will not affect the ongoing measurement.
 *  -# The transition to "Idle" state is done automatically after the measurement is completed.
 *      As long as the sensor is in the "In Operation" state, the #TSEN_STATUS_SENSOR_IN_OPERATION status flag is set.
 *  -# At the end of each measurement, the #TSEN_STATUS_MEASUREMENT_DONE status flag is set indicating that the measured
 *      temperature is available for read (using #Chip_TSen_GetValue).
 *      Logically, both the status information provided by HW and the result of a certain measurement is lost when a new
 *      measurement ends.
 *      Additionally, once the measurement result is read (using #Chip_TSen_GetValue), the #TSEN_INT_MEASUREMENT_RDY
 *      interrupt flag and consequently the #TSEN_STATUS_MEASUREMENT_DONE status flag are automatically cleared.
 *  .
 *
 * @par In order to perform a measurement:
 *  -# Initialize the Temperature Sensor block with default settings with #Chip_TSen_Init.
 *  -# If required, change resolution with #Chip_TSen_SetResolution.
 *  -# Start a measurement with #Chip_TSen_Start.
 *  -# Wait for the measurement to be ready (assess that with #Chip_TSen_ReadStatus).
 *  -# Read the measurement value with #Chip_TSen_GetValue.
 *  .
 *
 * @par Notes:
 *  - The native format of the temperature sensor uses a signed 10.6 2-complement fixed point representation
 *    and holds a non-human readable temperature in Kelvin. This is outputted by the #Chip_TSen_GetValue and
 *    Chip_TSen_Int_GetThreshold* functions and accepted by the Chip_TSen_NativeTo* and the Chip_TSen_Int_SetThreshold*
 *    functions.
 *  - The status information of the temperature sensor regarding a measurement can be read with #Chip_TSen_ReadStatus.
 *  - Interrupt generation when threshold is crossed (low and high) as well as when a measurement is ready can be set up
 *    and handled with Chip_TSen_Int_* functions.
 *  - The interrupt service routine, when needed, must be implemented in the scope of the application code.
 *  - Use the #Chip_TSen_NativeToCelsius, #Chip_TSen_NativeToFahrenheit and #Chip_TSen_NativeToKelvin functions to convert
 *    from a temperature in the native format into a temperature in, respectively, Celsius, Fahrenheit or Kelvin
 *    in a human readable fixed point decimal representation. In the inverse direction, use the #Chip_TSen_CelsiusToNative,
 *    #Chip_TSen_FahrenheitToNative and #Chip_TSen_KelvinToNative functions to convert from a temperature in, respectively
 *    Celsius, Fahrenheit or Kelvin in a readable fixed point decimal representation into a temperature in the native format.
 *  .
 *
 * @par Example 1 - Simple polled measurement.
 *  - resolution: 10 bits
 *  .
 *  @snippet tsen_nss_example_1.c tsen_nss_example_1
 *
 * @par Example 2 - Measurement with interrupt with restart.
 *  - resolution: 12 bits
 *  - interrupt generation: when low (18.75 degree celsius) or high (22.25 degree celsius) thresholds are crossed
 *  .
