/** @defgroup MODS_NSS_LED led: LED driver
 * @ingroup MODS_NSS
 * The LED driver provides an API to control bi-state (on/off) LEDs on a board. Each LED has a "handle" (e.g.
 * @c LED_(2)), and @c LED_On(LED_(2)) switches the third LED 'on'. In other words, the LED driver abstracts which
 * physical pin is used and the polarity of the control (active high or active low).
 *
 * It is expected that each board library includes this module, and configures the diversity settings of this module
 * (see led_dft.h) to match the LEDs on the board. The goal is that all applications can use LEDs using the same API
 * with the same behavior.
 *
 * @par How to use the module
 *  - The first step is to initialize the driver (via #LED_Init). Note that both the IOCON block and the GPIO block must
 *      have been initialized before.
 *  - Next, the LEDs are controlled via the other provided functions. All arguments are a mask. The first is always
 *      @c leds that identifies which LEDs will be targeted; example values are #LED_(0), #LED_(1) @c | #LED_(3),
 *      #LED_ALL.
 *      The second argument - if present - is @c states that identifies the new states for the LEDs. A bit value of @c 1
 *      indicates an 'on' value, a value of 0 indicates an 'off' value.
 *  .
 *
 * @par Diversity
 *  This module supports diversity: the number of LEDs it can control and how they are configured.
 *  Check @ref MODS_NSS_LED_DFT for all diversity parameters and their default values.
 *
 * @par Examples
 *  To shorten the examples any timing is left out. You may want to single step intersperse them with calls to
 *  #Chip_Clock_System_BusyWait_ms after each state change to see the full intended effect.
 *
 * @par Example 1 - Switching two LEDs in various ways
 *  @snippet led_mod_example_1.c led_mod_example_1
 *
 * @par Example 2 - Inspecting the state of LEDs
 *  @snippet led_mod_example_2.c led_mod_example_2
 *
 * @par Example 3 - Light bar
 *  @snippet led_mod_example_3.c led_mod_example_3
